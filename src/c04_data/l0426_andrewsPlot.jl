We now introduce a completely different way to visualize high-dimensional data.
The idea is to represent a data vector via a real-valued function.
For any individual vector,
such a transformation cannot be generally useful,
however, when comparing groups of vectors,
it may yield a way to visualize structural differences in the data.

In line 4,
the andrewsplot() function from StatsPlots is used to plot the data.
Note the @df macro is used in a similar format to that of Listing 4.23.
The first argument, :Species, determines how the data should be grouped,
while the second argument determines what variables should be included in the calculation,
in this case columns 1â€“4.
