    # We now introduce a completely different way to visualize high-dimensional data.
    # The idea is to represent a data vector via a real-valued function.
    # For any individual vector,
    # such a transformation cannot be generally useful,
    # however, when comparing groups of vectors,
    # it may yield a way to visualize structural differences in the data.

    iris = read_iris_from_csv("$(@__DIR__)/../../data/iris.csv")
    # the andrewsplot() function from StatsPlots is used to plot the data.
    # Note the @df macro is used in a similar format to that of Listing 4.23.
    # The first argument, :Species, determines how the data should be grouped,
    # while the second argument determines what variables should be included in the calculation,
    # in this case columns 1â€“4.
    @df iris andrewsplot(:Species, cols(1:4),
